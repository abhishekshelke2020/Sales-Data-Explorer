# Sales-Data-Explorer

This project is based on Sales Data Analysis. I cleaned and prepared the dataset, then used SQL to solve business-related queries such as sales trends, top-performing products, and category-wise performance. The project highlights how SQL can be applied to gain insights and support decision-making from raw sales data.
